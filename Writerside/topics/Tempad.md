# Tempad

Tempad is a mod that adds the Tempad item, a device inspired by the Loki show on Disney+ that allows you to open orange
rectangular portals to other locations saved in the Tempad.

This wiki will explain how a modpack author can configure Tempad to their liking, allowing you to change the color of the font,
the type of fuel the tempad uses, how much fuel it uses, and more!
